# 📄 Resume Categorization  

## 📌 Project Overview  
A job agency receives thousands of resumes every month but lacks an efficient classification system. The challenge is to categorize applicants into roles such as **engineers, HR professionals, and warehouse workers** based on their resumes.  

This project aims to:  
1️⃣ **Extract and structure key resume details** (position, experience, skills, courses) into a DataFrame.  
2️⃣ **Apply data wrangling and cleaning techniques** to process the resumes.  
3️⃣ **Perform analysis & visualizations** to gain insights from the categorized data.
